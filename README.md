# euCLId
A Command Line Interface for Achieving Similar Functionality to Geometer's Sketch Pad or Kig utilizing ONLY python 3 and its default packages. Design philosophy is centered around "purely geometric" construction, eschewing algebraic and numerical methods wherever possible (though we cannot utterly avoid them in an electronic medium).

## THIS IS VERY MUCH SO A WORK IN PROGRESS, AND IS SUBJECT TO MASSIVE, OCCASIONALLY BREAKING, CHANGES

*Eventually* meant to be imported into an interactive Python3 terminal session.

Work is being done on enabling TikZ generation from constructions done in euCLId.

EPS vector image generation is more or less functional.
