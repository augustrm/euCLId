# euCLId
A Command Line Interface for Achieving Similar Functionality to Geometer's Sketch Pad or Kig utilizing ONLY python 3 and its default packages (Python 3 with batteries included is available at https://www.python.org/downloads/); created as a for-fun academic exercise. Design philosophy is centered around "purely geometric" construction (as is done in Euclid's *Elements*), eschewing algebraic and numerical methods wherever possible (though we cannot utterly avoid them in an electronic medium).

## THIS IS VERY MUCH SO A WORK IN PROGRESS, AND IS SUBJECT TO MASSIVE, OCCASIONALLY BREAKING, CHANGES

Meant to be imported into an interactive Python3 terminal session.

Work is being done on enabling TikZ generation from constructions done in euCLId.

EPS vector image generation is more or less functional.

*Really big stretch goal is to re-write in Haskell and OpenGL for better performance (and as a fun exercise in functional programming!).*

Here's a couple animations made with euCLId:
