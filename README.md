# euCLId
A Command Line Interface for Achieving Similar Functionality to Geometer's Sketch Pad or Kig utilizing ONLY python 3 and its default packages. Design philosophy is centered around "purely geometric" construction, eschewing algebraic and numerical methods wherever possible (though we cannot utterly avoid them in an electronic medium).

*Eventually* meant to be imported into an interactive Python3 terminal session.

Work is being done on enabling TikZ generation from constructions done in euCLId.
